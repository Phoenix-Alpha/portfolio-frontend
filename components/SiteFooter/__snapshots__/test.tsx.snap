        Flatrock offers qualified investors the opportunity to invest in private companies. However, we do not make recommendations regarding the appropriateness of a particular opportunity for any particular investor. 
        <em>
          We are not investment advisers.
        </em>
          Investors must make their own investment decisions, either alone or with their personal advisors.Investing in private companies can be risky and unpredictable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some of the risks include a lack of liquidity, a lack of professional management, lack of access to capital, lack of financial controls, a concentration of the business in a small number of customers, reliance on a small management team, lack of financial information, and a lack of the shareholder protections associated with public companies. You should invest in small companies only if you can afford to lose your investment.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may provide financial projections for some of the investment opportunities listed on the Site. 
        <em>
          All such financial projections are only estimates based on current conditions and current assumptions.
        </em>
          The actual result of any investment is likely to be different than the original projection, often by a large amount. Neither we nor anyone else guaranties the results reflected in financial projections.
        <br />
        <br />
        * Target IRR is a projection based on capital gains (from an exit) and preferred dividends. These returns are not guaranteed and will vary by investment.
